# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid



### What I learned

Learnt how to use custom properties and still getting used to it.
Still learning about rem aswell, since when changed the font-size to 15px in the body, rem also changes and still trying to understand which one is better.


### Continued development

I would really love to get used to grid and flexbox techniques and get a better understanding of custom properties.
Also how to create a responsive Web Page since my first WebPage is not really good.
